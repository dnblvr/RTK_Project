# RTK_Project

This personal research project is my attempt at an IMU-based state estimator. The objective is to combine acceleration data, GPS position, and (possibly) anemometer speed or optical flow velocity to get our second-order states.

This project requires the following components:
* Teensy 4.1
* 4 x MPU-9250 modules
* ublox M10 GNSS module
